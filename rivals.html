<h1>
    Rivals
</h1>

<p>Because of the immense amount of natural talent this squid was born with, it is only natural for him to develop some rivals throughout his early years.</p>

<h2>
    Squidward Tentacles
</h2>

<p>Squidward was always envious of Kelpy's clarinet playing. Even though he can't help but love his music, Squidward seeks to one day rise above Kelpy and steal his spotlight.</p>

<h3>
    Squilliam Fancison
</h3>

<img src="squilliam.png" width="316">
<p>Squilliam, like Squidward, seeks to one day steal Kelpy's spotlight for his own. Instead of using his clarinet playing skills, Squilliam uses his abundance of money and good looks to try and gain popularity.</p>
